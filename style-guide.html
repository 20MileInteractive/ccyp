            <p class="intro">An introductory paragraph is a great way to summarise the content before the reader really digs into the detail of your story. With a .intro class attached, this special paragraph can have a unique text size while inheriting its other attributes from it's parent.</p>

            <p>This is a paragraph, which will probably be the most common element on your site. It's likely that the vertical rhythm of your site will be largely determined by the line-height of your paragraph.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Content can contain inline styles such as <a href="#">hyperlinks</a>. It's likely that the <strong>vertical rhythm</strong> of your site will be largely determined by the line-height of your <em>paragraph</em>.</p>
